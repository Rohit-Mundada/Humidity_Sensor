# Modelling of 2D-Material based Humidity Sensor - Development of circuit to drive the Humidity Sensor #

## VLSI Design/Circuit Design ##

This project is focused on displaying the humidity value in ppm (parts per million) from a humidity sensor. The humidity sensor outputs current in micro Amperes and this has to be converted into appropriate ppm values assuming a linear function between current and humidity.

Current (micro A) | Humidity (ppm)
